Using Reinforcement Learning to Detect Anomalies in Time Series Data
Description
This project applies reinforcement learning to improve anomaly detection in time-series data, focusing on enhancing accuracy and efficiency through adaptive learning and environmental interactions.

Key Steps
Data Preparation:

Load historical currency exchange rates from Eurostat.
Normalize data and engineer features to capture temporal patterns.
Model Building:

Develop a custom LSTM-based feature extractor.
Implement reinforcement learning models using Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO).
Training and Evaluation:

Train models using historical data.
Evaluate models with metrics like precision, recall, F1-score, and anomaly detection rate.
Fine-tune hyperparameters such as threshold values and window sizes.
Reward System:

Design and test different reward structures to optimize learning.
Installation
Ensure you have the following libraries installed:

PyTorch
Pandas
NumPy
Matplotlib
Install them using pip:

Copy code
pip install tensorflow torch pandas numpy matplotlib
Running the Project
Load the Python script (Using RL to detect anomalies.py).
Run the script to preprocess data, build models, train them, and evaluate their performance.
Conclusion
This project demonstrates the application of reinforcement learning techniques to achieve high performance in anomaly detection in time-series data. It highlights the importance of reward system design and hyperparameter tuning in improving model accuracy and efficiency.
